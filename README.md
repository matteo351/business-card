# Calling Card

In case you ever need my information and all you have is a terminal and `npm`.

## Usage

```bash
npx matteo-bulleri
```

Want to publish it so others can view it with `npx`?

- Update `package.json` and change the name, version, and other fields to make it yours.
- Push your code to a new public repository.
- [Sign up for an npm account](https://www.npmjs.com/signup), if you don't have one.
- Authenticate with `npm login`.
- Publish your package using `npm publish` from the project root.

For more info, check out the [official npm publish guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npm-publish).
